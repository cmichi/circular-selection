# Circular Selection

This repository contains a circular list selection interface for Android
Wear. The interface is optimized for round smartwatches. The app supports 
multiple, different interaction techniques for the list selection with the 
basic interaction being that the ring on the bezel of the smartwatch can
be used to select a sublist of a larger list.

I developed these conceptual ideas and the app in a small project which I did as 
part of my Master studies in the Media Informatics program at the University Ulm.
A modified version of the app has been used to conduct an academic study in which 
I evaluated different interaction techniques and interface variations against each 
other. In the study the usability of the interface has been evaluated in terms of 
speed, error rate, hedonistic qualities (i.e. user satisfaction), etc..
The results have in the meantime been published as an academic paper: 
[Circular Selection: Optimizing List Selection for Smartwatches](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2971766).

**Project Status:**
I have only tested the software with the Motorola Moto 360 and Android Wear 1
and am unsure how it behaves on other Smartwatches. This app shouldn't be 
taken as ready for production â€” it is a limited prototype that was 
used in a pre-defined setting and clear context.


## How it looks

![Circular Selection](https://github.com/cmichi/circular-selection/raw/master/images/circular-selection.png)

In the left photo the watch has a black area on the bottom. This "flat tire" is a hardware 
characteristic of the Moto 360, behind this black area sensors are placed. The app 
itself is independent of this shortcoming.

### Interface Variations

![Circular Selection](https://github.com/cmichi/circular-selection/raw/master/images/sketches.png)

The app supports a couple of variables which can be tweaked to adapt the
interface. The above illustration depicts possible results.

 * *Direction* of the characters on the ring (A-Z or Z-A)
 * *Interaction technique*: How a character is selected (Single Tap, Rotation, etc.)
 * *Button Size*: The buttons for individual characters on the ring can be
   either of equal size for all buttons or the button size can be different
   for each character, based on the size of the sublist behind it (i.e.
   the number of items which start with this certain character, meaning
   they have this character as a first character).

The paper mentioned above describes the influence of all these variables on the usability 
of the interface in further detail.
