# Circular Selection

This repository contains a circular list selection interface for Android
Wear. The interface is optimized for round smartwatches. The app supports 
multiple, different interaction techniques for the list selection.

I developed these conceptual ideas and the app in a small project which I did as 
part of my Master studies in the Media Informatics program at the University Ulm.
As a next step, I conducted an academic study to evaluate different interaction
techniques and interface variations against each other. The results have in
the meantime been published as an academic paper: 
Circular Selection: Optimizing List Selection for Smartwatches.
